## 🐺 One Night Ultimate Werewolf — Vibe Coding Project at Network School  
This project is a web-based implementation of **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**, created during my learning journey at **Network School** using a Vibe Coding approach and deployed with modern web tooling.  

One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a fast-paced social deduction game where each player receives a secret role (such as Werewolf, Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, Villager, etc.).  
Unlike traditional Werewolf, the game lasts only a single night: players perform their roles in sequence, some roles may be swapped, and then everyone must rely on logic, memory, and conversation to determine who the Werewolves are.  

This application is designed as a **digital game master** for offline board game sessions and social gatherings. It helps automate and structure the entire flow of the game:  
- Room creation and joining with short room codes  
- Automatic role setup based on player count  
- Guided night phase with correct role order  
- Clear role instructions and rule explanations  
- A smooth, phone-friendly interface for group play  

The goal of this project is both educational and practical: to practice full-stack web development through Vibe Coding, and to build a real, playable product that enhances in-person social gameplay.
